# the len() function calculates the length of a sequence


# the max() and min() functions will find the largest and smallest value in a sequence


# the str() function will return a string version of an object
prefix = "result: "
result = 5


# range(start, stop, step) will create a range of numbers 
# You can use ranges along with loops 


# the print function itself is pretty flexible - you can embed variables directly in it
